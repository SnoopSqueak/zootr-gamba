# What is this?

This is a one-page offline app that generates .json files for use with [Ship of Harkinian](https://www.shipofharkinian.com/).

It was created so that [Jiby6666](https://www.twitch.tv/jiby6666) and others can randomize most of the major items in the game into one room. The idea is that livestream viewers can spend channel points to make predictions about which item will be found next.

# How to use?

Download the zootr-gamba-(version).html file from this repository.

Run it in your web browser.

Whenever you want a new seed, click "Generate". It will ask you where you would like to save it.

# Can it do anything else?

Probably not. The code is simple and small. Maybe someday more features will be added, like custom locations and items, but for now users can modify the arrays themselves.
